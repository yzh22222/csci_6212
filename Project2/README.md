Project Title: CSCI 6212 Project  2

Name: Zihan Yang

RunningInstruction: 
I use IDLE Shell 3.13.7 to run the code
When you run the code, it will output the experimental results and theoretical results when the range of n is [10, 100000]
(n is multiplied by 10 each time)

if you don't have NumPy library installed,
you might need to use this command
pip3 install numpy 
in terminal to install the library to run the code
